# wirelessNoticeBoard-using-flaskAndTkinter
Simple wireless noticeboard using flask and Tkinter.

It uses flask API to receive images and display it using tkinter GUI.

To send image file a crude html page is used that can be accessible using IP address.


## Steps:

    - Open raspberryPi folder
    - Run "app.py" to start server.
    - Run "display.py" to start GUI.
    - Go to IP address mentioned in "app.py" (ex. http://192.168.1.100:5000). You can even change this ip address.
    - Upload picture on displayed html page.
    - changes should reflect on GUI.
